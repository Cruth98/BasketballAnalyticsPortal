# Basketball Analytics Portal

This repository contains the source code and analytics workflows powering the
**Bellarmine Analytics Portal**, an interactive web application built to support
data-driven decision-making for the Bellarmine Knights, a Division I men’s basketball program.

The application is designed to translate raw basketball data into **actionable
insight** for coaches, staff, and analysts through structured data pipelines,
analytics, and interactive visual interfaces.

Live Application:

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how data science and analytics can be
applied in a real operational setting to:

- Centralize disparate datasets
- Standardize metrics and analysis
- Enable non-technical stakeholders to explore insights interactively
- Support evaluation, planning, and performance analysis

While the domain is basketball, the underlying approach mirrors **business
analytics and decision-support systems** used in finance, operations, and
strategy roles.
